##### Concept of variable #####

# quiz = 50
# homework = 80
# result = (homework + quiz * 2) /2
#
# print "My result is ", result
#
# ##### Calculations #####
#
# problem: convert a temperature from celcius to Farenheit

# temp_celcius = 15
# temp_far = temp_celcius * 9 / 5 + 32
#
# print "My result is ", temp_far
#
# ##### Variable and loops #####
#
# # loop 1
# result = 0
# for i in range(4):
#     result = i
#     print "My result is ", i
#     print "My result is ", result

#
# # loop 2
# result = 0
# for i in range(4):
#     result = i + result
#
# print "My result is ", result
#
# ##### Conditionals #####
#
# # problem: decide wether a number is odd or even
#
n = 66
if (n%2 == 0):
    result = "even"
else:
    result = "odd"
#
print "The condition is ", (n%2 == 0)
print "My result is ", result
